# BreedNet__Deep-Transfer-Learning-for-Dog-Classification
This project uses transfer learning for dog breed classification, leveraging LFW for human detection and Stanford Dogs Dataset for classification. It employs HAAR cascades, pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50), and PyTorch for training. Extensive data preprocessing, augmentation, and fine-tuning ensured high accuracy.
